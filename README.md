Manual decoy
This is just a small project done with a student (dwulf) to create decoy databases for proteome identifications independently of software. A csv file can be read in, which contains any number of annotations, and together with the protein sequences, a decoy database can be created in faa format. 
Thereby, we used decoy.pl - copyright (C) 2006, Matrix science Limited (Script is free software - GNU License).
